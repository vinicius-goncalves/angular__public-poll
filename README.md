 # ðŸ“Š Public Poll

Create public polls and share them with anyone you want to.

<div>

## Introdution

Create and share polls, those are the main ideias and purposes of this project - creating using Angular, you can create polls and anyone who accesses the app will be able to see all of the polls or share polls with everybody throught the poll id. All of the polls have a `expire time`, meaning they will be deleted within 24 hours starting from the creation time. All of the polls (will be) stored in a MongoDB server.
